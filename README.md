🐸 Toad Runner — WebGL Subliminal Priming Experiment (Unity 6.0)

Toad Runner is a Unity 6.0 (6000.0.50f1) WebGL project developed for a bachelor’s dissertation examining whether subliminal visual cues can influence directional choices in a short browser-based game. The project includes both the game itself and the supporting infrastructure required for running the study remotely.

The repository contains:

A lightweight framework for remote data collection using Firebase Realtime Database

Server-side processing and validation through Firebase Cloud Functions

A simple Unity–JavaScript WebGL bridge for backend communication

The full game logic used for the experiment, including controlled randomisation and group assignment

Diagrams documenting the software architecture, data flow, and gameplay sequence

The playable study version is available on itch.io:
https://jekdersnek.itch.io/toad-runner-study

This setup was designed to support even distribution between experimental groups, minimise opportunities for data manipulation, and synchronise gameplay and survey responses for analysis. The project may serve as a reference for creating similar small-scale behavioural experiments in Unity WebGL environments.

If you plan to integrate Firebase with Unity WebGL, Domenico Rotolo’s tutorial provides a clear introduction:
